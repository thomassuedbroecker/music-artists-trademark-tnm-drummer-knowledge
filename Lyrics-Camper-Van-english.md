# Camper-Van

Lyrics made by DerBurnsi and TNM - Drummer

## Verse 1
Wheels are turning, sunrise burning,
We pack our dreams, it's time to go.
Across the land, with friends our wheels are turning,
Life's a journey, let us take it slow.

## Pre-Chorus
No hurry, no worries, just the open road,
With the ocean's whisper, with heavy or tiny load.

## Chorus
The road's our stage, miles are our rhythm,
Stop and rest At any time
camper life is where we shine.
No need for much to feel the thrill,
Camper friends, we can climb every hill.

Living is free in camper vans.

## Verse 2
Mini or micro homes on wheels, we're gliding,
Every mile, a brand new view.
With laughter and fun, we're riding,
Into horizons, bold and true.

## Pre-Chorus
No hurry, no worries, just the open road,
With the ocean's whisper, and a heavy load.

## Chorus
The road's our stage, miles are our rhythm,
Stop and rest At any time
camper life is where we shine.
No need for much to feel the thrill,
Camper friends, we can climb every hill.

## Bridge
Stars above, the night is calling,
Campfires burning, our spirits enthralling.

## Chorus
The road's our stage, miles are our rhythm,
Stop and rest At any time
camper life is where we shine.
No need for much to feel the thrill,
Camper friends, we can climb every hill.

Living is free in camper vans.

## Outro
From dawn to dusk, we keep on driving,
Finding new adventure.
With friends beside, weâ€™re always thriving,
We love our camper vans, forever.
