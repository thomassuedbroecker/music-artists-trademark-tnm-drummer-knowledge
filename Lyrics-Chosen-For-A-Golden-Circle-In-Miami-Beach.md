# Chosen For A Golden Circle In Miami Beach

Lyrics by TNM - Drummer:

## Intro
Yo, welcome to Miami, where the sunshineâ€™s bright,
Dreams take flight in the vibrant night.
From neon lights to starry skies above,
Let's groove, feel the rhythm, feel the love.

## Verse 1
Dancing and having fun at Miami Beach parties,
Arriving in style, under the palm trees.
Dreamliners descending, setting the mood right,
Working hard together, celebrate harder, under the neon light.

Grooving to the beat, under the starry skies,
Miami Beach, where the energy never dies.
Perfect dinner under the moon's gentle glow,
In this city of rhythm, where we all flow.

## Chorus
Miami Beach, where dreams take flight,
Chosen for the golden circle, what a sight.
Working hard celebrate harder, sharing in the jubilee,
Miami Beach, where we all feel free.

## Solo

## Verse 2
Laughter fills the air, at the poolside so cool,
Splashing and playing, breaking every rule.
The wealthy and locals, in joyous harmony,
In Miami Beach, where we all feel free.

Savoring the flavors, at the perfect dinner feast,
In this paradise of flavors, where every bite's a treat.
Fun at the pool, under the warm night sky,
In Miami Beach, where spirits soar high.

## Chorus
Miami, Miami Beach, where dreams take flight,
Chosen for the golden circle, what a sight.
Working hard celebrate harder, sharing in the jubilee,
Miami Beach, where we all feel free.

These are the days of the bright side of life

## Bridge
In the rhythm of the night, we find our groove,
Working hard together, celebrate harder, under the neon light.
At the pool or at dinner, joy never ends,
In Miami Beach, where unity transcends.

## Chorus
Miami, Miami Beach, where dreams take flight,
Chosen for the golden circle, what a sight.
Working hard celebrate harder, sharing in the jubilee,
Miami Beach, where we all feel free.
These are the days of the bright side of life

## Chorus
Miami, Miami Beach, where dreams take flight,
Chosen for the golden circle, what a sight.
Working hard celebrate harder, sharing in the jubilee,
Miami Beach, where we all feel free.

## First-Outro
From parties to dinners, and by the pool's cool,
In Miami Beach, where we break every rule.
Being diverse is what rules together we soar,
Miami Beach, a place we all adore, forevermore.

## Solo

Savoring the flavors, at the perfect dinner feast,
